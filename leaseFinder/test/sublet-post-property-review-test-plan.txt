File created on 4/24/2020 by Jas Bawa

- The title of the page, "Lease Finder", is visible

- Navigation Bar is visible and each link connects to the appropriate page when clicked

- The correct address shows on the top

- There should be three rows of property and sublet post card, plus a write a review card, and 0 or more review cards

- The first row of cards has two cards which contain sublet post information
    - The left card should have specific contract details: occupants, bedrooms available, Monthly Rent, and start and end dates
    - The right card should have general lease details: if it's furnished, if there's parking available, any house rules,
      if it's available, and any description (if available)

- The second row has one card, spanning the full width of the body. This row contains icons representing each utility
  plus an other utility icon at the end. If the utility is included in the rent for that sublease, it should be lit up green
  otherwise it should be gray and partially opaque. Also, when you leave your mouse over the icon for a small period, a
  tooltip should pop up saying: utility + ("included" | "not included").

- The third row has two cards, which contain property information
    - The first card is landlord information for this specific property. The details include: landlord name, landlord email,
      landlord phone number, and landlord website.
    - The second card on the right is property information. Details include the total number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and
      if it is pet friendly.

- For all of the above cards, if the model field is a boolean, an appropriate result should appear on the screen (as opposed
  to true or false). Some are, "yes" | "no", "included"| "not included", etc.

- Below the three rows, is a header for "Reviews", and contains all review data
    - There should be a write a review card for as the top left card among all review cards. This card should have a form
      with fields for the number of stars and the review itself. This form is only visible if the user is signed in as a student.
      Otherwise the form is replace with text prompting the user to sign in as a student if they wish to leave a review.
    - The rest of the page contains any and all reviews left for that property. The reviews show up in a masonry brick style,
      going a left to right, top to bottom list.

- Checking that all styling, bootstrap and user-defined, is showing up as expected.
